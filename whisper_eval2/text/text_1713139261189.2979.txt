If you can assist us with an out-risk missing person, they were last seen at Q Queen and 23rd. Be clarified that MP was last seen headed westbound on Q. It's going to be an Elijah, a no-b and male Black 19 wearing a light gray jacket and blue pants. 14, I'm going to have to have pre-M2 for this night in phase 2 and 1A.
